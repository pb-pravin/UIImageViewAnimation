# Image View Animation

Demo of doing simple animations in iOS.
Code based on Erica Sadun's iOS Cookbook, modified too!

# Notes
* Here, create an array populated by individual images loaded from files
* assign this array to UIImageView instance's animationImages property
* Set the animationDuration to the total loop time for dipslaying the images in the array
* begin animated with the startAnimating: message -- there's a matching stopAnimation: for this as well
